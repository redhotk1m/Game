# The-Adventures-of-Henrik
Old Zelda like RPG game i made during my first year of college. The code is horrible, as i had no understanding of access modifiers / objects and generally any coding structure. However, the game is quite fun.
# What i learned
- Basic Java
- JavaFX and FXML
- Arraylists
- Animation
- Tilesheets
- Sounds / Music
- Optimazition (Render only what the user can see, to save memory)
- Saving and loading to/from a file
- Mapcreation
- Multilayered tiles to create a "3D look"
- Some github commands
